# Building a Password Strength Classifier Model Using NLP TF IDF 
Password Strength Classifier Using NLP and Logistic Regression. The task is to check Password strength using Logistic Regression ML Model. For Processing the text data I've used TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on rules(such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.)

# Problem Defination 
Password strength is used to measure how effective a password is against external attacks. External attacks are in form of password cracking or brute-force attacks. They aim to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network. The strength of a password is usually measured using its complexity, length, and unpredictability.
Cyber crimes and data breaches are on the rise, and the main cause for this is usually compromised passwords.
