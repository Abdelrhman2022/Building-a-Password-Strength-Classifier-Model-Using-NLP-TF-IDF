# Building-a-Password-Strength-Classifier-Model-Using-NLP-TF-IDF-
Password Strength Classifier Using NLP and Logistic Regression. The task is to check Password strength using Logistic Regression ML Model. For Processing the text data I've used TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on rules(such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.)
